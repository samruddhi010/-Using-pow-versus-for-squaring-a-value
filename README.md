# Using-pow-versus-for-squaring-a-value

Required time for multiplication= 2.7585
Required time for pow function = 6.00248
Relative cost for computation= 2.176
considering the above reasons I can say that using the pow function to square a value is not a good idea. from the above results we can see that the pow function is taking almost more than twice the time the multiplication function is taking  and the relative computational cost is around 2.176.As per the results I can say that using the pow function is not only time consuming but costlier compare to multiplication functioon.
